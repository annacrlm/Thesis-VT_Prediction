# Thesis: VT Prediction

This repository contains all the code used in my masters thesis on predicting Ventricular Tachycardia in patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, using ML and DL models, based on longitudinal laboratory test data spanning years. This data was received from Catharina Hospital Eindhoven and was collected as part of the COMBAT-VT research (https://combatvt.nl/), where this data cannot be shared as it contains sensitive information. 

This data was first cleaned and preprocessed (as shown in the two cleaning files) by removing any unnecessary lab tests, patient data or unusable results, and then transformed into summary features (shown in the summary features file). Then the models were developed and evaluated, with the Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and MLP being trained on the summary features data, while the LSTM was trained on the cleaned lab data. Within their corresponding files, their results and performance evaluation metrics can be seen, with applications of imputation techniques to address missingess for the summary feature data, and with oversampling techniques to address class imbalance for all the models. The XGBoost had the highest performance of all, with high evaluation metrics, and therefore SHAP explainability was used for interpreting and understanding the decisions made by the model, as can be seen in the XGBoost code file.
